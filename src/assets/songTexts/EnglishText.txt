It was a quiet night, a simple hello,
A message I almost didn’t notice though.
We didn’t know what fate would do,
But something in my heart led me to you.

Behind the screen, your gentle smile,
Changed everything in just a while.
One honest word, one moment true,
And deep inside I knew: I was made for lovin’ you.

I didn’t plan it, I didn’t pretend,
Suddenly you became my friend.
My dream, my reason, my truth so new,
The missing piece I never knew.

Armine, you became my heartbeat,
My every silence, every heartbeat.
If love could speak, if love were true,
It would whisper softly: I was made for lovin’ you.

Let the world fall, let time run fast,
I want this moment forever to last.
With every breath, with everything I do,
I was made for lovin’ you.

Days turned into endless talks,
Late-night dreams and quiet walks.
Your voice became my favorite sound,
My safest place when I felt lost and drowned.

You believed when I couldn’t see,
The man I was supposed to be.
Inside your eyes I saw my truth,
And once again I knew: I was made for lovin’ you.

When the world was heavy on my soul,
You made my broken pieces whole.
Through you I learned what love can do,
How hearts can heal when they’re held by you.

If one day my voice fades away,
My heart will find the words to say.
If I get lost in the dark and blue,
I’ll find my way back home to you.

And if the stars forget to shine,
And every dream runs out of time,
I’ll still be here, still choosing you,
’Cause I was made for lovin’ you.

Armine, you became my heartbeat,
No matter where this life takes us to,
With every breath, with everything I do,
I was made for lovin’ you.

This is not just a song, it’s my truth.
Every page of my life leads back to you.
And when the world fades into blue,
There will be only us…
And I was made for lovin’ you.
